## Overview

`slurm-gcp` is an open-source software solution that enables setting up
[Slurm clusters](./docs/glossary.md#slurm) on
[Google Cloud Platform](./docs/glossary.md#gcp) with ease. With it, you can
create and manage [Slurm](./docs/glossary.md#slurm) cluster infrastructure in
[GCP](./docs/glossary.md#gcp), deployed in different configurations.

Google's
[HPC Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/new-google-cloud-hpc-toolkit),
on [github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/hpc-toolkit), can be used to
manage and deploy [Slurm clusters](./docs/glossary.md#slurm) and other
supporting infrastrucutre via
[HPC Blueprints](https://cloud.google.com/hpc-toolkit/docs/setup/hpc-blueprint).

See [supported Operating Systems](./docs/images.md#supported-operating-systems).

[Slurm User mailing list](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mail.html) or the
[Google Cloud & Slurm Community Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-cloud-slurm-discuss).

## Cluster Configurations

`slurm-gcp` can be deployed and used in different configurations and methods to
meet your computing needs.

See
[HPC Blueprints](https://cloud.google.com/hpc-toolkit/docs/setup/hpc-blueprint)
for
[HPC Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/new-google-cloud-hpc-toolkit)
example cluster configurations that are production ready.

### Cloud

All Slurm cluster resources will exist in the cloud.

See the [Cloud Cluster Guide](./docs/cloud.md) for details.

### Hybrid

Only Slurm compute nodes will exist in the cloud. The Slurm controller and other
Slurm components will remain in the onprem environment.

See the [Hybrid Cluster Guide](./docs/hybrid.md) for details.

### Multi-Cluster/Federation

Two or more clusters are connected, allowing for jobs to be submitted from and
ran on different clusters. This can be a mix between onprem and cloud clusters.

See the [Federated Cluster Guide](./docs/federation.md) for details.

## Upgrade to v5

See the [Upgrade to v5 Guide](./docs/upgrade_to_v5.md) for details.
